# poster
Use this for your poster

There are two relatively simple packages for posters: Posterdown and Pagedown.
Both are installed and you would us `library()` at the console to load them.


To start create a blank document "with template" and you will see a big list of templates.  On the right you will see what package
the template comes from.  Select a posterdown or pagedown html template. *Do not click create empty document!* We want to get their set ups.

The idea with this is that you will run the code directly when knitting your rmarkdown file.  The only thing I would say is do not download the data, instead
`load()` the saved copy of your data set. 

This blog post gives you some idea of how to go about creating the poster with posterdown.  There are other options but I think this is the easiest.
